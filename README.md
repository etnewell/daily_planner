# daily_planner

#Goal
I was tasked with creating a daily planner from a basic layout given to me. 

#Features
This planner takes input in each of the hours given, saving the inputs in local storage and loaded into each box. it also will change the colors of the box based on your local timezone. It will have a color for times in the future, times in the present and times in the past. Additionally, since it is saved to your local machine, the inputs will remain until you clear it from storage.

#Obstacles
I had a diffictulty creating the correct loops to make each one of these processes consolidated, so in order to save time to ensure completion I did it a simpler, though more type-heavy way. As Mark Twain once said, 'If I had more time, I would've written less'.
